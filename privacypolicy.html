      <p>Effective date: October 2025</p>

      <p>TwoArrowsUP develops and publishes mobile games and apps, including <strong>RootFather</strong> and future titles. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and protect your information when you use our games, apps and website.</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> Our games use third-party advertising providers (such as Google AdMob) which may collect device identifiers and usage data to show personalized or contextual ads.</li>
        <li><strong>Purchases:</strong> When you buy in-app items (e.g. “Leaf” premium currency), the purchase is processed securely by Google Play or Apple App Store. We do not store your credit card or billing information.</li>
        <li><strong>Gameplay Data:</strong> We may store progress, scores, achievements and items locally on your device and in secure cloud storage to allow saving and restoring progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Website:</strong> Our website (twoarrowsup.com) may collect anonymous analytics or standard server logs (IP address, browser type, etc.).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide core gameplay, save progress and enable features such as achievements.</li>
        <li>To show ads and reward users for viewing ads.</li>
        <li>To process in-app purchases.</li>
        <li>To improve our products and detect errors or abuse.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>Our games are intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent and believe your child has provided personal data, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

      <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Depending on your location (e.g. EU/EEA under GDPR or California under CCPA), you may have rights to access, delete or opt-out of data processing. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@twoarrowsup.com">info@twoarrowsup.com</a> for requests.</p>

      <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal information. Limited data may be shared with third-party providers (AdMob, Unity Services, analytics) strictly for delivering ads, purchases, or app services.</p>

      <h2>6. Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable measures to protect data. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

      <h2>7. Changes</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Updates will be posted at this page with a new “Effective date”.</p>
